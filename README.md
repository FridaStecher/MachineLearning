Police brutality is one of the most serious, enduring and controversial human rights violations in the United States. The problem exists at the national level and is institutionalized. For these reasons, the US federal government (as well as state and local governments, which are bound by international human rights standards to which the United States is bound) deserves to be held accountable by international human rights bodies and the international public opinion.

Our main objective is to create a model that predicts the number of homicides perpetrated by the police in the states with an above-average police crime rate. We also focus on victims whose gender is male, between the ages of 22 and 38, and the ethnicities detected in our analysis are Black/African American, White/European, and Latino; since they are the most affected ethnic groups.

Our motivation is to bring to the attention of the American public the details of this long-standing problem that affects their entire society.

We aim at those responsible for social policies, so that they can take this data and generate concrete actions that help reduce violence (for example, through training for police forces)

The main dataset used comes from Kaggle (fatal_encounters_dot_org), which in turn is made up of information gathered from various sources (according to the author's description).

This is data regarding police violence in different states of the United States between the years 2000 and 2020 and has information on the victims, such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.

We complement this dataset with economic indicators (macro_monthly.csv) for the same country and period, also obtained in Kaggle.

Additionally, we have a dataset with the number of inhabitants by state and year (for the same period) that we put together manually using data from Census.gov.
